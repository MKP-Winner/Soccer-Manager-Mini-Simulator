# ‚öΩ Soccer Manager Mini-Sim

## Project Overview

This project is a simple, browser-based **Soccer Manager Mini-Simulation** designed to model match outcomes between various world-class football teams based on their rating. It includes dynamic commentary, a risk/reward substitution mini-game, a scoreboard, and integrated background music controlled by the user.

## üë• Team Contributions

This project was a collaborative effort between the two team members listed below. Our planning and instructional materials were developed jointly, while implementation was divided by language/task expertise.

| Team Member | Primary Role | Key Contributions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jose** | **HTML Structure & CSS Styling** | Created the **entire foundational HTML** structure (buttons, selectors, scoreboard, stadium, alert box). Implemented all **CSS styling** to give the website its look and feel. |
| **Mithun** | **JavaScript Logic & Configuration** | Developed the **core game logic** (match simulation, scoring, team rating updates, the 'time bomb' sequence). Implemented the **song selection and audio player functionality** (handling song files, volume ducking, toggling music). |

| **Shared Contributions** |
| :--- |
| **Project Slides** | Collaborative design and creation of all project presentation slides. |

## üõ†Ô∏è AI Tool Utilization

During the development and documentation process, our team leveraged an AI assistant (specifically, Gemini/Google's AI model) for the following tasks:

1. **Code Integration and Refactoring:** Assisting in the correct integration of complex JavaScript logic (e.g., the audio setup and event listeners) into the existing HTML structure.
2. **Code Review and Debugging:** Verifying JavaScript event handling (like the new `helpBtn` function and `songSelect` population) to ensure no conflicts existed.
3. **Documentation Generation:** Drafting and formatting this comprehensive `README.md` to clearly define project scope and accurately track individual contributions for fair grading.

**Disclaimer:** AI tools were used for generating boilerplate code structure, validating logic, and drafting documentation. All core game logic, design choices, and file compilation were performed and verified by the team members.
